                <l1 class="title">The Collector is an important, integral part in the creation  of great art. Without the incremental collection and preservation of the work  it never meets the critical mass of the work as a whole.<br>
                <br>
I ask that you  register as a &quot;Collector of Elaine Rader's Work&quot; so that my effort  can be concentrated at some time in the future to create a retrospective and an  art book so that I may project my work into the future.<br>
<br>
I will ask for your  help in these efforts in the future and I also ask that periodically you photograph  your complete collection so that I will know what your interest and taste  include and also for archival interest in the future. I will also have museum  exhibitions in which I will ask you to loan your parts of your collection. <br>
<br>
Many of you I know  have significant collections, if you are a serious Collector and have collected  my work in the past and you are interested in being a &quot;Collector of Elaine  Rader's Work&quot; please contact me and send photographs of your collection  and I will include you on all preview showing that will improve your  collection.</p>

 <l1 class="title">I have added below a historic comment about collecting and collectors for you interest expressed in "The Albertina in Vienna".<br>
<br>
"Collecting is not the same as accumulating art works. Certainly, owning treasures, rarities and the pictorial, crafted, sculptural inventions of geniuses was for centuries characteristic of intelligent societies.  Much, if not everything, from these earlier epochs was thereby saved from the ravages of time, and much of our awareness of the value of artistic activity and our knowledge about past masters and their achievements has been similarly sustained.  
Of course, the desire to win such works may later have found other motivations, but the satisfaction in the property itself and in the status its value may confer has remained constant, as has the interest in the depicted subject (landscape, figure, or abstract).  But, perhaps the ultimate reason for acquiring art stems from the need to be moved inwardly, the need for an experience of an intellectual or spiritual nature.  All this can motivate a collector but collecting is more than this.
  As the activity of ordering and discerning, comparing and clarifying, collecting unites us with the multiplicity of the world: in short, it is a fulfillment of what seems to some to be one of the obligations of being truly human."
